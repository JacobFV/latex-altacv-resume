% \cvsection{Bio}
% I was the nerd in primary school: learning VB6 in 5th grade and using it to make toy applications, moving to C\# a year later for writing homework helpers through middle and high school, and (finally!) discovering the world outside Microsoft (HTML/CSS/JS, typescript, Python) beginning in high school. After graduating, I got active in a full time ministry while working part time. Later that year, I stumbled across \verb|arxiv.org|, started reading, and fell into the `let's create AI' black hole. I'm still there, and if I get to meet you, I hope to pull you in! 

%% \cvsubsection{Why are you into AI?}

%% Well let me clarify, the term `AI' often just refers to the frontier of computer science R\&D, but I mean AI in the original sense of the term: ``the science and engineering of making intelligent machines'', for example, developing a computer program that can control its own computer and reprogram itself to achieve a wide variety of tasks in various problem domains (that's actually my side project). I'm sure you can imagine many other exciting ways that ``intelligent machines'' would be useful. 

% \cvsubsection{Can you relate a challenge you've overcome?}

% Getting up after my DIY'ed Cookie Cutter CNC EDM head shorted out the lab in 9th grade in front of my entire class, teacher, and principal was probably the hardest challenge I've faced. I'd spent dozens of hours, written hundreds of lines of code, learned so many fundamental science and engineering concepts, and the reward was very discouraging. But I couldn't give up on engineering or even that project. The very next day, \href{https://youtu.be/yGfpX0WXYFM}{I presented on Cookie Cutter project and its present and planned features}. Throughout the Summer, I quenched my newly ignited passion for calculus, differential equations, fluid dynamics, electricity, and material science with hundreds of textbook pages. And it is my resolve to continue moving forward as an engineer, regardless of the setbacks I experience.

% \cvsubsection{Where do you see yourself in 5 years?}

% Honestly, I donâ€™t know! I try to take one day at a time so I can focus my energy. And seriously, with the baffling rate of AI capabilities advancement, I couldn't even say what 1 year might look like. Whatever circumstances come, I aim for an action-oriented life.
